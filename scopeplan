Goal: A simulation of colonies of various lifeforms. 

Lifeforms will have
- hunger and/or thirst, which must be satisfied

Animal (roughly speaking, things that move) lifeforms will have:
- gender, which determines reproductive compatibility
- location
- lists of in-group lifeforms and out-group lifeforms, which affect reproductive compatibility as well as hostility
- depravity, or mental state, which will affect behaviour
- communication of information
- communication of disease
- food gathering

Plant (static) lifeforms will have:
- regeneration
- asexual reproduction

To facilitate the communication of attributes, an Attribute abstract class will probably be needed. 
It will have a method that applies the effect of the Attribute on the owner. 
It will have a copy constructor. 

In the environment, on the ground, there will be just water and grass. 

As for weather:
Rain will expand water bodies and water grass.
Sun will shrink water bodies and dry grass, and also exacerbate animal thirst.
